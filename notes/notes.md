## General Notes

From the paper, they note that the best-fit parameters for the demand and probability functions were found to be:

a = 0.00667
b = 0.00291
d = 13
g = 4.95
h = 0.117

We see from the paper that their fare structure is in the range of 15 pounds to 150 pounds.

Willingness to pay function might be better modeled using a logit function

1/ (1 + exp(a - b\*y)) where y is the price. a/b is the "market" price
