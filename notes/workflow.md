## Workflow

1. Choose optimal parameters for the initial investigation
2. Set ground truth assumptions for the model explicitly/clearly
3. Run simulation/optimisation with these initial parameters to see what the optimal pricing looks like
4. Compare the results to data seen in the expedia dataset for specific legs, so we can infer something about what sort of models the airlines would be using/if what we are doing is realistic
5. Perform sensitivity analysis, how does the optimal dynamic price change with slight perturbations in the underlying model assumptions about demand, probabilities etc
6. Run monte carlo simulations to see the distribution of outcomes we might expect given our assumptions
